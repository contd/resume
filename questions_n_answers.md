## Tell us about your experience in the traditional sysadmin environment. *
Initially started out supporting a Novel NetWare environment for a 200+ employee company.  While working for a couple start-ups setting up and maintaining our own servers and network equipment was necessary.  Then while working for the University of Cincinnati I had to take over the role of systems engineer for and employee that had left.  This data center supported both NetWare and Active Directory for 200+ faculty and over 20 computer classrooms and labs.  It also comprised of several Blade Centers use to enable the IT faculty and students to utilize VMware for virtual labs and various virtual networks for teaching purposes.
Also while working for these companies I was hosting linux servers from home with a static IP to host web sites for friends and family while maintaining security and performance.

## Tell us about your experience with cloud engineering (kubernetes, terraform, etc). *
Most of my professional experience with cloud engineering and orchestration has been with AWS and Cloud Formation. I started to help move over to Terraform at the last company I did software development.  I've used both Kubernetes and Terraform for small contract jobs and personal projects pretty extensively over the last 2 years. I completed a project designing a full Kubernetes cluster deployment in AWS and its on Github https://github.com/contd/devops-projects.

## What is your current software engineering daily work:
The last software engineering position's daily work involved a combination of coding, code reviewing, testing and documenting my daily work.  Some days there would be customer engagement when they needed changes or adding new data sources to the pipeline.  Also since we were fully remote any new tool or change made required updates to the developer wiki and regular communication on Slack groups.

## Stack Overflow:
I am making my way back to the software engineering world after a long break involving graduate school and teaching for a year.  I've been trying to go freelance and finally figuring out I just really love to code. During the last couple of years I've been retooling and self training. Mostly in Go, Javascript, Node.js and the Vue/React/Redux frontend frameworks. I have a lot of good experience from a variety of areas which I think makes me very versatile and shows my ability to learn fast and adapt well. For fun I love to travel abroad and trying very hard to learn Spanish. Love outdoors and being active as much as I can physically and in the community.

## Tell us about a software engineering project you were involved in. *
The most recent being a set of micro services designed to be a distributed data ingestion pipeline.  The customers would decide how they would regularly send their sensor data and the "onboarding" app would "divide and conquer" meaning it would divide up between services and stages the process of gathering, converting and storing the raw sensor data into standard SenML stored on the customers' choice of providers.

## Our teams include engineers that worked at larger companies, on critical projects with significant outcomes. Share your similar background with us.
The most recent for me was with a company that was fully remote and 100% utilization of SaaS and PaaS services.  The main customers were big automotive like Nissan, Toyota and Hersheys and my role involved quite a bit of customer engagement.  I was complimented on being able to work well with customers especially in helping them with very technical problems with non-technical people.
