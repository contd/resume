=== Experience

==== Desktop Support Admin

_https://www.roundtower.com/[Roundtower] - March 2019 - September 2019_

The client support services team needed a desktop support on-site lead
for a customer and as a favor to the team lead who is my brother-in-law
agreed to contract the position until they found a full time
replacement. Responsibilities included supporting all aspects of
building and maintaining IT equipment and over 300 employees at the
client location (CNSI - Rockville, MD). Other responsibilities included
data center equipment maintenance and monitoring.

==== Software Engineer

Worked with both customers and other developers to develop various tools
and additions to the data ingestion pipeline, which fed the main
product. Worked heavily on and with micro-services and AWS in a
fast-paced, scrum driven, fully remote and very agile development team.
Being remote for 90% of the team, communication and documentation was
vital. During a transition of project management, my team began the
switch to TypeScript and more sophisticated AWS/ECS integration for both
testing and continuous integration.

Benchmarks] - March 2013 - November 2014_

Participated in all phases of the software development life-cycle,
including the architecture of solutions, creation of design
documentation, coding and developing test plans. Provided multiple
aspects to solve problems and coordinate team discussions to decide on
the best solution not only for the given problem but, for potential
larger issues. Helped to provide leadership to the team and mentor more
junior developers. Brought a creative perspective to projects and/or
solutions to problems so as to broaden the scope and determine other
potential impacts throughout the product line and/or customers.
Constantly stayed current on the latest technologies and best practices

monitors or monitoring of sensor data projects which included a real
time assessment of the general public’s physical safety from potential
harm due to certain weather conditions. (see Paper below). The systems
grew as several new projects were taken on at the beginning and through
the time spent there. Most projects involved pretty complex decision
making and time critical scheduling often times over unreliable
connections and several weather damaging events. Lead the group into
rebuilding the whole system into a more robust and standardized solution
from code down to methods for implementing new systems and new features.
